# CPE 315 Lab 1 -- Piku
### Name
- Justin Huynh
### Status of lab
  - Complete!
### Compilation instructions
  - `gcc -o piku piku.s` 
  - `./piku`
### Issues along the way
  - It was a bit tricky figuring out how to get connected to the Raspberry Pi \
  and the vpn at first.
  - In addition, I initially ran the code on my machine and not the pi server,\
   and was confused as to why I encountered compilation errors, but it all made\
   sense when I checked Piazza.
